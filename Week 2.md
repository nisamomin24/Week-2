A. How did the authors use both Qualitative and Quantitative assessment approaches? What benefits did each approach yield?
The author of the paper researched about the user participation in the IS security risk management. Since not a lot of work has been done to find the relationship between the above so the authors used qualitative assessment 
as it works better with models with uncertainty and where quantitative assessment is unable to measure the outcomes.


Benefits of using the qualitative assessment as per the author:
1. The approach helps with assessing the behaviour, activities and assignment of user participation in the IS risk management.
2. The second benefit is it applies the user participation theory by Markus and Mao (2004) to model the process as a framework which includes 
the creation of psychological buy-in.
. Relationship among users and developers.
. Improvement of system quality (Markus and Mao, 2004).
           
The quantitative method was then used on the models derived by the qualitative assessment.
Benefit of using the quantitative assessment as per the author:
1. The model derived by qualitative assessment helped in the formation of the basis of the quantitative assessment.
Both qualitative and quantitative assessment helped formed strong results and contexts.

B. What do the authors list as the advantages of involving users in the risk management process?
.The users gave important insights about the business objectives, values and needs that IS staff alone would not be able to consider and form the basis of the business.
.Users also shared business knowledge with the risk managers and auditors when assessing the risk and designing controls.
.Users provided business knowledge to understand the risks associated with it.
.The controls and processes were aligned with the business needs keeping in mind the risks.



C. Based on the findings of the research, 
i. How will the lack of user access affect the risk assessment you will carry out as part of your assessment?
The users give insights into the business process which eventually is important to identify the risks in the SRM. The risk assessment process involves understanding the business needs and aligning the security as per the commercial need. The assessment would not yield necessary information about the risks if user access is affected or limited. 
ii. Will it affect the choice of Qualitative vs. Quantitative assessment methods you utilise?
The paper highlighted the purpose and the benefits of using both qualitative and quantitative assessment to establish the SRM model. Both the approaches are equally important as per the paper and hence would be used in the assessment.
iii. How might you mitigate any issues encountered?
Taking into account the business needs and deciding on the right model would be difficult. Incorporating the qualitative and quantitative assessment and determining the outcomes would also pose a challenge. 
Understanding the business model and researching similar business would help to identify the commercial needs, models, security risks and how to provide safe business services.
